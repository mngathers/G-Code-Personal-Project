        <a>Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism.

        Someone who eats a plant-based vegan “diet” does not eat anything that comes from an animal/living being. Instead of buying packaged food from the store they focus on buying fresh fruits and veggies and things that do not have a lot of weird ingredients.
