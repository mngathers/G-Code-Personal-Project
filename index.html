        <a>Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism.

        <h3>Plant-Based vs. Vegan</h3>
        <div><img id="versus-img" src="https://www.forksoverknives.com/wp-content/uploads/FOK-Plant-Based-vs-Vegan-social-UPDATED-COLOR.jpg" alt="chart comparing vegan and plant-based"></div>
        <p class="differences">There continues to be confusion between vegan vs. plant-based. Although plant-based can be misinterpretted as "just eating plants", it does not mean that someone who eats plant-based is a vegan. Those who are plant-based consume animal products although the frequency could be less than someone who is on a S.A.D. (Standard American Diet)</p>
        <p class="questions">What does it mean to be plant-based vegan?</p>
    <p class="answers">
        Someone who considers themselves to be a plant-based vegan has a diet that consists mainly of whole fruits and vegetables, and seeds and nuts.

        <p class="answers">
            Someone who eats a plant-based vegan “diet” does not eat anything that comes from an animal/living being. Instead of buying packaged food from the store they focus on buying fresh fruits and veggies and things that do not have a lot of weird ingredients.
